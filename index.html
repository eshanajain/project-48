                        <p> MY HOBBY IS READING INTERESTING AND KNOWLEDGEBLE BOOKS IN MY FREE TIME. WHENEVER I GO TO HOME FROM MY SCHOOL I LIKE TO READSUCH BOOKS AFTER COMPLETING MY HOME WORK. I AM 11 YEARS AND READ IN CLASS 6TH STANDERED. NOW I KNOW VERY WELL THAT READING IS VERY GOOD HABBIT WHICH CAN MAKE ME A COMPLETE. THIS HOBBY CAN BE DEVELOPED BY ANYONE HOWEVER I GOT THIS NATURALLY . READING BOOKS KEEP ONE ALWAYS HAPPY AND BUSY . IT IS THE GOOD SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT,KNOWLEDGE, INSPIRATION AND INSTRUCTION. IT MAKES US DISPLINED, LOYAL,PUNCUTION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A SUCCESSFUL PERSON IN THE LIFE.</p>
